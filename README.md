# turntable

Supercharge your events using Turntable. You and your guests can queue music, see what's playing and relive the event
months later with History playlists.

The turntable app provides events with a robust playlist collaboration tool, removing the complexities of choosing music for
your events.

Turntable is great for house parties, dinner parties, chilling with friends and pre-drinks before a big night out on the town. 

Connect your Spotify account to an event session so you can add tracks to your library from within the app and share them
with others.

## Installation

Before opening the .xcworkspace file please check the required pods are installed. If pods are missing use terminal or command line,
move into the project directory and run pod install. Once this is complete the project should function correctly.

```bash
pod list
pod install
```

When using the source code, app secrets are stored in the AppDelegate file. If using github source these secrets will not be in the source
code. Please request the details (or obtain them from the supporting materials folder) and replace the sample text with the corrisponding values.
